        Ans) The wages of farm labourers in Palampur are less than minimum wages because:<br><br>
        ==> There is heavy competition for work among the farmers.<br><br>
        ==> Employment is less and farmers are more and, therefore, farmers have to be content with whatever they are
        earning.<br><br>
        ==> Land is owned by landlords who desire to earn more and more money by giving minimum wages.<br><br>
        ==> The farmers are illiterate and unaware of the amount of minimum wages set by government.<br><br>

        5. What are the different ways of increasing production on the same piece of land?<br><br>
        Ans) The land is under cultivation is practically fixed, so to increase the production form a same piece of
        land, we can use the following methods-<br><br>
        ==> Multiple Cropping- It is most common way of increasing production on a given piece of land. It means when
        two or more crops are grown on the same piece of land during a year, i.e. farmers should grow at least two main
        crops in a year. In India, some farmers are growing third crops also over the last 20 years such as in Palampur,
        Jowar and bajra are grown and potato is the third crop.<br><br>
        ==> Modern Farming- Production on the same piece of land can also be increased by adopting modern methods of
        farming. The green revolution in India is a remarkable example of it. Under modern farming more cultivable area
        should be brought under high yielding varieties of seeds and irrigation. The use of farm machinery such as
        tractors, threshers and harvesters, makes cultivation faster and also help in increasing yield per
        hectare.<br><br>

        6. How do medium and large farmers obtain capital for farming? How is it different from small farmers?<br><br>
        Ans)<br><br>
        ==> All farmers require capital during production. They require field as well as working capital.<br><br>
        ==> Medium and large farmers have their own savings from farming.<br><br>
        ==> They are able to arrange for their own capital. They sell their surplus in the market. A part of this is
        saved and the rest is used to buy machinery and other raw materials or lend to small farmers to make more
        profit.<br><br>
        ==> Whereas the small farmers have to borrow money to arrange for capital. They borrow from large farmers, money
        lenders and traders. They are charged very high interest.<br><br>

        activities-<br><br>
        ==> Ploughs the field by bullocks.<br><br>
        ==> Sows the seed by simply sprinkling with hands.<br><br>
        ==> Waters the field with the help of Persian wheel.<br><br>

        8. What can be done so that non farming activities can be started in village?<br><br>
        Ans) Supply of electricity in villages needs to be improved. This will encourage the establishment of small
        scale industries.<br><br>
        ==> More villages should be connected to the towns and cities through all weather road transport and telephonic
        system.<br><br>
        ==> The villages should have markets where goods and services produced can be sold such as in Palampur,

        and services.<br><br>
        1) Land- It is a passive factor of production. It requires human effort to make it a productive resource. No
        activity can take place in the absence of land and it is the basis of all human activities.<br><br>
        2)Labour- The second requirement is labour, i.e., people who will do the work. Some activities require educated
        and skilled labour to perform the necessary tasks and others require the workers who can do the manual
        work.<br><br>
        3)Physical capital- The third requirement is physical capital, i.e., the variety of inputs like machines, tools,
        raw materials and money are required at each stage of production. It is further divided into fixed capital and
        working capital.<br><br>
        4)Human Capital-It is the knowledge and enterprise to be able to put together land, labour and physical capital
        to produce an output either to use for themselves or to sell in the market.<br><br>

        Q9: What is the difference between “Disguised Unemployment” and “Seasonal Unemployment”?<br><br>
        ANSEWR:-<br><br>
        A)Disguised unemployment:- In case of disguised unemployment, people appear to be employed but they are actually
        unemployed.
        For example:- Sometimes in agriculture families eight people are working on a farm, whereas only four people are
        needed to do that work. Thus, four people are surplus and they are not needed on farm. They also do not help to
        increase the production. If these four people are removed from the farm, the production from the farm will not
        decrease. Therefore, these four people appear to be employed but are actually disguisedly unemployed.<br><br>
        B)Seasonal unemployment:- Seasonal unemployment happens when people are not able to find jobs during some months
        of the year. People dependent on agriculture usually face such problem. There are certain busy seasons when
        Sowing, Harvesting, Weeding and Threshing are done. When the plants are growing , there is not much work. During
        this period, they remain unemployed and said to be seasonally unemployed.<br><br>

        Q10: Which capital would you consider the best Land, Labour, Physical capital and Human capital?<br><br>
        ANSWER:-<br><br>
        Human capital is the best capital because it can make use of Land, Labour and Physical capital. The other
        factors cannot become useful on their own. The knowledge expertise in a human enables him to develop Land,
        Labour and Physical capital to produce an output for his own use or to sell in the market.<br><br>

        ANSWER:-<br><br>
