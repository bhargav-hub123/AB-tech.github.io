        3. Women did not enjoy political rights and hold political offices like men.<br><br>

        exemption from paying taxes.<br><br>
        • 2nd Estate – Nobility. The nobles and other rich people were also exempted from paying taxes. They also

        servants. Peasants made up of 90% of the population, but only a small number of them owned the lands which they
        cultivated.60% of the land was owned by the nobles and the church. The church also extracted taxes from the

        Q11. Which three causes led to Subsistence crisis in France during Old Regime?<br><br>
        ANS. The following are the causes that led to subsistence crisis in France during Old Regime-<br><br>
        • The population of France increased from 23 million in 1715 to 28 million in 1789. This led to the increase in
        the demand for food grains.<br><br>
        • When the production of food grains could not keep pace with the growing demand, the price of bread which was
        the staple food increased rapidly.<br><br>
        • On the other hand, the wages could not keep pace with the rise in prices. At the time of drought or hail,
        harvest reduced and things worsened. Thus, the gap between the poor and the rich widened and this led to the
        subsistence crisis.<br><br>
