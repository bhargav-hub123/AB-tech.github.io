  • When the production of food grains could not keep pace with the growing demand, the price of bread which was the staple food increased rapidly.<br><br>

  Ans) The land is under cultivation is practically fixed, so to increase the production form a same piece of land, we can use the following methods-<br><br>

It means when two or more crops are grown on the same piece of land during a year, i.e. farmers should grow at least two main crops in a year. In India, some farmers are growing third crops also over the last 20 years such as in Palampur, Jowar and bajra are grown and potato is the third crop.<br><br>
  ==> Modern Farming- Production on the same piece of land can also be increased by adopting modern methods of farming. The green revolution in India is a remarkable example of it. Under modern farming more cultivable area should be brought under high yielding varieties of seeds and irrigation. The use of farm machinery such as tractors, threshers and harvesters, makes cultivation faster and also help in increasing yield per hectare.<br><br>

      Q9: What is the difference between “Disguised Unemployment” and “Seasonal Unemployment”?<br><br>
  ANSEWR:-<br><br>
  A)Disguised unemployment:- In case of disguised unemployment, people appear to be employed but they are actually unemployed.
  For example:- Sometimes in agriculture families eight people are working on a farm, whereas only four people are needed to do that work. Thus, four people are surplus and they are not needed on farm. They also do not help to increase the production. If these four people are removed from the farm, the production from the farm will not decrease. Therefore, these four people appear to be employed but are actually disguisedly unemployed.<br><br>
  B)Seasonal unemployment:- Seasonal unemployment happens when people are not able to find jobs during some months of the year. People dependent on agriculture usually face such problem. There are certain busy seasons when Sowing, Harvesting, Weeding and Threshing are done. When the plants are growing , there is not much work. During this period, they remain unemployed and said to be seasonally unemployed.<br><br>
